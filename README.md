 " Better Notes, better grades with NotePal"

## Description:
NotePal is a platform built for students to help them write better notes and save time studying. It is designed to be the pal students need to take better notes and understand lectures more effectively.

One of the key features of NotePal is the use of the ChatGPT API to automatically correct grammatical mistakes and provide a descriptive title for each set of notes. This helps to ensure that the notes are easy to read and understand, making them more useful for studying.

In addition to this, NotePal also allows students to add tags to their notes, making it easier for other users to search for similar notes on the platform. This helps to save time by allowing students to quickly find relevant notes on a particular topic, rather than having to search through multiple sources.

After students have finished writing their notes, they can share them on the platform's feed, where they can be accessed by other users. This helps to build a community of students who can collaborate and share their notes with one another, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the material.

Overall, NotePal is a valuable tool for students looking to improve their note-taking skills and save time studying. It is user-friendly and easy to use, making it a great resource for students of all levels.
